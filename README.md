### Hi there, I'm Philip Tait 👋

I'm a third-year Computer Science student at **Strathmore University** with a strong foundation in full-stack web development and a growing passion for the world of Data Science.

I enjoy building complete applications from the ground up. You can see my work in my **[Club-Management-System](https://github.com/Philtait/Club-System)** project, a full-stack application I developed and deployed on a live server. I am now channeling that same dedication into building my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.

-   🌱 I’m currently focused on deepening my knowledge in **Data Science methodologies**.
-   💡 I'm actively looking for an **internship or attachment** where I can contribute to a data-driven team and gain hands-on experience.
